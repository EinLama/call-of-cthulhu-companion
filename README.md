# Call of Cthulhu Companion

Since Covid started, we've been playing our CoC adventures mostly virtually. Getting my pen and paper out, just to sit in front of a screen felt weird.

When I was in front of a computer anyways, I might as well make use of it and delegate the boring things (manage HP, tracking successfull skill rolls, etc.) to it.

This project is an attempt to do so. At the same time, it shall help me relax at the end of a work day.
I will try out new things here and merge things while they are still in an experimental state. Reverting designs and breaking changes might happen frequently.

## How to run, etc.

This is a pretty standard Rails application with no tweaks so far. Follow the [official guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) to set it up and run it.
